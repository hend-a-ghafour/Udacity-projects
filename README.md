## ***Death & Life Expectancy for Mothers & Children:***
### Overview:
The dataset analyzes seven indicators impacting maternal and child health from 1995 to 2010 across six
WHO regions. These indicators include Total Fertility Rate, Percentage of Births Attended by Skilled Health
Staff, Child Mortality Rate, Maternal Mortality Rate, Average Life Expectancy, Total Health Spending per
Person in USD, and Percentage of Total Health Expenditure in GDP.
### Tools and Techniques:
- ***Programming Language:*** Python
- ***Visualization:*** Matplotlib
- ***Libraries:*** Pandas, NumPy
### Role and Responsibilities:
- ***Data Analysis:*** Evaluated health indicators for each region over the specified period.
- ***Comparative Analysis:*** Compared indicators across regions and years to identify trends and patterns.
- ***Additional Research:*** Investigated improvements, inconsistencies, and relationships between indicators.
### Challenges Faced:
- Addressed data quality issues such as null values and unpivoting columns.
- Managed large datasets by segmenting countries into regions for effective analysis.
### Achievements:
- ***Trend Identification:*** Noted trends such as decreasing Total Fertility Rates, Child Mortality Rates, and
Maternal Mortality Rates across all regions.
- ***Regional Insights:*** Identified which regions had the highest and lowest values for each indicator.
- ***Correlation Analysis:*** Found relationships between health expenditure indicators and various health
outcomes.
### Insights:
- ***Total Fertility Rate:*** Decreased overall, with AFR showing the highest rates and EUR the lowest.
- ***Births Attended by Skilled Health Staff:*** Highest in EUR and lowest in AFR. Inconsistencies in data
affected the ability to determine relationships with other indicators.
- ***Child Mortality Rate:*** Decreased globally, with AFR having the highest and EUR the lowest rates.
Maternal Mortality Rate: Showed a global decrease, with AFR experiencing the highest rates and EUR
the lowest.
- ***Average Life Expectancy:*** Increased across regions, with EUR having the highest and AFR the lowest.
- ***Total Health Spending per Person:*** Showed an overall increase, with EUR spending the most and SEAR
the least. It is considered a reliable indicator, though its impact on skilled birth attendance showed
variability.
- ***Percentage of Total Health Expenditure in GDP:*** Generally increased, with EUR having the highest and
EMR the lowest. It is considered a Significant indicator affecting health metrics, but with regional
inconsistencies.
### Future Applications:
- Compare findings with global health indicators from the same period.
- Investigate regional improvements and inconsistencies in health metrics.
- Explore reasons behind the decline in health expenditure and its impact on other indicators, especially
in the SEAR region and in 2009.

## ***US Bikeshare:***
### Overview:
This project analyzed bikeshare data from Chicago, New York City, and Washington to uncover usage
patterns and user demographics.
### Tools and Techniques:
- ***Programming Language:*** Python
- ***Libraries:*** Pandas, NumPy
### Role and Responsibilities:
I independently conducted all aspects of the project, including coding the analysis scripts, and preparing
and presenting findings.
### Challenges Faced:
- Developed an interactive terminal script for real-time statistics based on user input.
- Managed data discrepancies across cities and datasets.
### Achievements:
- ***Popular Times of Travel:*** Identified the most common month, day of the week, and hour of the day for
bike rentals.
- ***Popular Stations and Trips:*** Determined the most common start and end stations, as well as the most
frequent trips.
- ***Trip Duration:*** Calculated total and average travel times.
- ***User Info:*** Counted each user type (e.g., subscriber, customer), & Analyzed gender-specific data and birth
years for NYC and Chicago.
### Insights:
- Peak rental times align with commuting hours, suggesting daily transportation use.
- Popular stations are near landmarks or transportation hubs, indicating high-demand areas.
- Average ride lengths and travel time variability provided insights into trip duration.
- User demographics analysis revealed the composition by user type and gender.
### Future Applications:
- Expand analysis to additional cities or more recent data for evolving usage patterns.
- Enhance the terminal script's interactivity for detailed queries and customized outputs.
- Explore correlations between bikeshare usage and external factors such as weather or events.
